This is a repository for miscellaneous notebooks in machine learning and other topics that I don't feel deserve individual repositories. Most notebooks are either notebooks for kaggle contests or the result of following along with tutorials, making modifications as I see fit. 
For example, the CNN notebook was made when I was loosely following a pytorch tutorial on a convolutional neural network classifier for MNIST. I added stochastic weight averaging and a learning rate scheduler to the training procedure, which improved the test accuracy.
